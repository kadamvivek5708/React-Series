setAttribute(prop, value) ‚Üí calls the method properly.
setAttribute = (prop, value) ‚Üí replaces the method with a variable, breaking it.

üìù Summary: How React Actually Works Under the Hood
This video takes a hands-on approach to explain the core mechanics of React by guiding you through the process of building your own custom version of the React library from scratch.

The Core Idea: From JavaScript Object to HTML
The main goal is to understand how React takes your code and renders it on a web page.

The "Root" Element: Every React application starts with a simple HTML file (usually index.html) that contains a single <div> element, typically with an id="root". This div is the container where your entire application will be injected. [03:01]

React Elements are Just Objects: What you write in JSX (e.g., <a href="https://google.com">Click me</a>) isn't directly understood by the browser. A tool like Babel or Vite transpiles (converts) this JSX into a JavaScript object. This object, which the video calls a "React element," has a predictable structure: [06:29]

type: The HTML tag name (e.g., 'a').

props: An object containing the attributes (e.g., { href: '...', target: '...' }).

children: The content inside the tag (e.g., 'Click me').

Building a Custom render Function
The video demonstrates how to write a custom customRender function that mimics what ReactDOM.render() does. This function takes two arguments: the "React element" object and the container (root div). [09:12]

Here‚Äôs how it works:

Create a DOM Element: It uses document.createElement() to create a real HTML element based on the type from the object (e.g., creates an <a> tag). [10:03]

Set the Content: It sets the innerHTML of the new element to the children from the object.

Set the Attributes: It loops through the props object and uses setAttribute() to add all the necessary attributes (like href and target) to the HTML element. [15:43]

Append to the DOM: Finally, it appends this fully-formed element to the main container (root div), making it visible on the page. [12:55]

Key Takeaways about JSX
JSX is Syntactic Sugar: JSX is just a convenient way to write what will eventually become a JavaScript object. The video shows that React.createElement() is the actual function that creates this object structure. [30:37]

Evaluated Expressions: When you see curly braces {} in JSX (e.g., <h1>Hello, {username}</h1>), you are using an "evaluated expression." This means you can only put JavaScript inside the braces that results in a final value (like a variable or a function call). You cannot write full if statements or for loops inside them. [35:02]

By building a mini-React from scratch, the video demystifies the "magic" of the library, showing that at its core, React is a clever and efficient system for turning JavaScript objects into DOM elements.
