Highlights: React Password Generator Project
This project teaches how to build a password generator and introduces several important React hooks.

useState: Used to manage all the interactive pieces of the app:

The password length (length).

Whether numbers are allowed (numberAllowed).

Whether special characters are allowed (charAllowed).

The final generated password (password). [10:28]

useEffect: This hook is used to automatically re-run the password generation logic whenever any of its dependencies (length, number/character toggles) change. This makes the app reactive. [36:08]

useCallback: This hook is wrapped around the password generation function. It memoizes (remembers) the function, so it only gets re-created when its dependencies change. This is a performance optimization. [14:52]

useRef: This hook is used to get a direct reference to the password input field. This allows you to implement features like selecting the text and copying it to the clipboard. [43:34]

Copy to Clipboard: The video shows how to use the browser's navigator.clipboard.writeText() method to easily copy the generated password when a button is clicked. [47:48]
