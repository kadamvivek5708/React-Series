Highlights: React Interview Question on useState
The Interview Trap: An interviewer might ask you what happens if you call setCounter(counter + 1) four times in a row inside a single function. [02:22]

The Problem: You would expect the counter to increase by 4, but it only increases by 1. [03:41]

Why It Happens (Batching): React batches state updates for performance. When you call setCounter multiple times in one go, React sees that you're updating the same state and bundles them into a single update. All four calls use the same initial value of counter, so the result is just counter + 1. [04:12]

The Solution: To make it work correctly, you need to pass a callback function to setCounter. This function automatically receives the most up-to-date previous state. [05:07]

Correct Code: setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)

Why It Works: When you use a callback, React queues up these functions and executes them one by one, ensuring each update is based on the result of the previous one. This correctly increases the counter by 4. [07:25]
