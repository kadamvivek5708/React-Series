learning:
1. when making components, always capitalize name(function).
2. file extension .jsx , bcz some libraries force us for that
3. return only 1 components


üìù Summary: React Folder Structure & Core Concepts (Create React App vs. Vite)
This video explains the fundamental concepts of how React works by comparing the project structures of Create React App (CRA) and Vite.

foundational Concepts
HTML & JavaScript Connection: At its core, any web application, including React, works by injecting JavaScript into an HTML file to manipulate what's displayed on the page.

Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM (a copy of the actual browser DOM). When data changes, React updates its Virtual DOM first, compares it with the real DOM, and then only updates the specific parts of the page that have changed. This is much more efficient than reloading the entire page. [07:53]

Create React App (CRA) Project Structure
When you create a project with CRA, you get several files and folders:

node_modules/: Contains all the third-party libraries and packages your project needs.

public/: This folder contains the main index.html file.

index.html: This is the single page that loads in the browser. It has a <div> with an id, usually id="root". React injects all its content into this div. [04:39]

src/: This is where you write your application code.

index.js: This is the entry point of your React application. It finds the root div in index.html and tells React to render your main App component inside it. [06:37]

App.js: This is your main component. It's a JavaScript function that returns HTML-like code called JSX. [11:33]

package.json: Contains metadata about your project and lists its dependencies. [02:51]

Behind the scenes, react-scripts automatically injects your JavaScript code into index.html when you run the development server. [12:51]

Vite Project Structure
Vite is a more modern and lightweight build tool. Its structure is simpler:

Direct Injection: Unlike CRA, Vite's index.html file is in the root directory. It directly links to your main JavaScript file (e.g., main.jsx) using a <script> tag. This makes the development process faster. [14:57]

Key JSX Rules
Uppercase Component Names: Component functions must start with an uppercase letter (e.g., function Chai()). [18:07]

Return a Single Element: A component can only return one parent HTML element. If you need to return multiple elements, wrap them in a container like a <div> or a React Fragment (<>...</>). [23:20]

By understanding these core concepts, you'll find it much easier to work with React, no matter which build tool you use. Happy coding! üòä
