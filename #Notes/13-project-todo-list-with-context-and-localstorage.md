# Summary: Project 4 - Todo List with Context API & Local Storage (Chai aur Code)

This video combines the **Context API** with browser **Local Storage** to build a complete and persistent Todo List application. This is a very common and practical project for mastering React state management.

### New Concepts & Important Points

* **Using Context for Complex State** `[00:05:06]`
    * **Description:** This project demonstrates how the Context API is perfect for managing more complex state that involves multiple related actions (add, update, delete, toggle).
    * **Example:** A `TodoContext` is created to hold not just the `todos` array, but also all the functions that can manipulate it (`addTodo`, `updateTodo`, `deleteTodo`, `toggleComplete`). This keeps all the todo logic centralized and easily accessible to any component.

* **Persisting State with Local Storage** `[00:00:35]`
    * **Description:** Local Storage is a browser feature that lets you save key-value pairs that persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed. This is perfect for saving user data like todo items.
    * **How it Works:**
        1.  **Saving Data:** When the `todos` state changes, a `useEffect` hook is triggered. It converts the `todos` array into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()` and saves it to Local Storage under a key (e.g., "todos"). `[00:46:08]`
        2.  **Loading Data:** When the application first loads, another `useEffect` (with an empty dependency array) runs once. It retrieves the JSON string from Local Storage using `localStorage.getItem("todos")` and parses it back into a JavaScript array with `JSON.parse()` to initialize the state. `[00:42:03]`

* **Full CRUD Functionality**
    * **Description:** The video implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the todos.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Create (`addTodo`):** Adds a new todo object with a unique ID (`Date.now()`). `[00:27:10]`
        * **Update (`updateTodo`):** Maps over the existing todos and replaces the one with a matching ID. `[00:29:18]`
        * **Delete (`deleteTodo`):** Uses the `.filter()` method to create a new array without the deleted todo. `[00:33:26]`
        * **Toggle Complete (`toggleComplete`):** Maps over the todos and flips the `completed` boolean for the matching todo. `[00:35:31]`

* **Component-Based Architecture**
    * **Description:** The application is broken down into logical components (`TodoForm` for adding todos and `TodoItem` for displaying/editing individual todos), which is a core principle of React development. This makes the code clean and manageable. `[00:48:03]`
