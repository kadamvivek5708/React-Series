Highlights: Tailwind CSS & React Props
Setting up Tailwind CSS:

The video gives a step-by-step guide on how to add Tailwind CSS to a React project created with Vite. [03:59]

This involves installing a few packages (tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer), creating configuration files, and adding Tailwind's directives to your main CSS file. [05:12]

Once set up, you can style your components directly in the JSX using Tailwind's utility classes (e.g., bg-green-400, rounded-xl). [09:05]

What are Props?:

Props (short for properties) are how you pass data from a parent component down to a child component. This is the key to making your components reusable. [14:04]

Think of them like arguments you pass to a function.

How to Use Props:

Passing Props: You pass props to a component as if they were HTML attributes. For example: <Card username="Ganu" btnText="Click Me" />. [18:25]

Receiving Props: The child component (Card in this case) receives these props as a single object. You can access the values using dot notation (e.g., props.username). [23:57]

Destructuring Props: A cleaner way to receive props is by destructuring them directly in the component's function signature: function Card({ username, btnText }). This lets you use username directly instead of props.username. [24:32]

Default Values: You can set default values for props in case they aren't passed down from the parent. This makes your components more robust. Example: function Card({ username, btnText = "Visit Me" }). [27:31]
