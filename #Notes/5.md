Highlights: useState Hook in React
The Core Problem: The video first shows that updating a normal JavaScript variable (let counter) in a React component does not update the UI. The value changes, but you won't see it on the screen. [09:31]

Why Hooks?: Hooks are React's way of telling the UI that it needs to re-render when a value changes. They bridge the gap between your variable updates and what the user sees. [11:08]

Introducing useState: This is the hook used to manage state (variables that change) in functional components.

You import it from React: import { useState } from 'react'. [15:21]

It returns an array with two things: the current state value and a function to update it. Example: const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0). [17:53]

How to Update State: You must use the updater function (setCounter) to change the state. You cannot directly change the state variable (e.g., counter = counter + 1). Using setCounter(counter + 1) tells React to re-render the component with the new value. [20:21]
