# h1 Highlights: Virtual DOM, Fiber, and Reconciliation

Core Problem React Solves: Traditional websites re-render the entire page for every small change, which is inefficient. React introduced the concept of a Virtual DOM to solve this. [03:46]

What is the Virtual DOM?: It's a lightweight copy of the real browser DOM (the structure of your webpage) that exists in memory. React works with this copy to figure out the most efficient way to update the actual screen. [04:01]

What is **Reconciliation**?: This is the name of the algorithm React uses to compare two Virtual DOM trees. When your app's state changes (e.g., you click a button), React creates a new Virtual DOM tree and compares it to the previous one. This comparison process is called "**diffing**." Reconciliation is the algorithm that efficiently finds these differences. [10:28]

The Evolution to React Fiber:

The old reconciliation algorithm (called the Stack Reconciler) had a problem: once it started comparing the trees, it couldn't be interrupted. For complex apps, this could cause the UI to freeze or lag. [04:50]

**React Fiber** is the new, completely rewritten reconciliation algorithm. It's the engine that powers modern React. [06:42]

Key Features of React Fiber (Why it's better):

- Item one Incremental Rendering: Fiber can break down the rendering work into small chunks. It doesn't have to do it all at once. [07:17]

- Pausable and Resumable: It can pause the rendering work to handle more important tasks (like an animation or user input) and then come back to it later. [07:58]

- Priority Levels: Fiber can assign different priorities to updates. An animation update is more important than a data-fetching update in the background, and Fiber can prioritize accordingly. [08:04]

Better for Complex UI: These features make Fiber much more suitable for building smooth and responsive user interfaces, especially those with animations, gestures, and complex layouts.

How Reconciliation Works with Keys:

When you render a list of items, React needs a way to track each item individually. This is why you must provide a unique and stable key prop for each element in a list. The key helps the reconciliation algorithm quickly identify which items have been added, removed, or re-ordered, which dramatically improves performance. [15:04]


**HYDRATION** : The time when a site is rendered on client side but js is not rendered.
